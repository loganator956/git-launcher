# git-launcher

[Home](https://loganator956.github.io)

This is a simple C# .NET console app that is made to simply execute a `git-bash.exe` from a portable git "install".  

I made it to allow me to have a familiar environment for development with all my desired personal configurations to allow for an improved workflow.
In this case, it simply launches `git-bash.exe` with a custom `HOME` environment variable and some arguments.
